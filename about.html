		<h1>How They Met</h1>
		<p class="about-us-info">First semester, freshman year of college, Eric was introduced to Caitlyn by a mutual friend, Adam. Adam attended Saint Rose with Caitlyn and they lived down the hall from each other. Eric attended UAlbany (10 minutes down the road) and was Adam's friend from high school. Adam invited Eric to tag along with his St Rose group of friends for parties, dinners, mall outings, etc. As Caitlyn and Eric got to know each other, they spoke more and more, starting Facebook chatting, and eventually texting day-in and day-out. As the beginnings of the relationship were starting, it was time for everyone to go home for a one month winter break. Throughout their break, Eric and Caitlyn talked every day.  They smiled and giggled over panda videos and learned more about each other. When they came back from break, it took less than one week for Eric to make it official.  </p>

		<h1>The Bride &amp; Groom</h1>
		<p class="about-us-info">Eric and Caitlyn have been dating for over 6 years. Eric asked Caitlyn to be his girlfriend on January 23, 2011. Throughout their relationship, they've actually spent more time apart than they have together. Through college summers spent apart, Caitlyn studying abroad in London, Eric spending some time in Los Angeles, and Eric living in Washington, DC, they've kept their relationship strong through weekend visits, texting, Facetime, and phone calls on drives home from work. The saying "distance makes the heart grow fonder" truly applies to them, because they cherish every moment they get to spend together while supporting each other in building their lives and careers. They currently (and finally!) both live in Alexandria, VA together with their perfect husky Loki.</p>

	<h1>How He Asked</h1>
		<p class="about-us-info">Eric and Caitlyn's families got together for Thanksgiving 2016 at Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia. The day after Thanksgiving, everyone went out to visit the D-Day Memorial. After a walking tour and quick visit to the gift shop, the group split up. The "grown-ups" went shopping in town, and the "kids" - Eric, Caitlyn, Eddie, and Christine - went hiking on a nearby mountain called Peaks of Otter (abbreviated as POO). This was fun but also quite exhausting, especially for Caitlyn who happened to have tonsillitis that weekend. They were determined to get to the top before sunset, but unfortunately Caitlyn had to stop and rest for a bit. Eric suggested they stop and sit on a big rock to relax for a little bit while Eddie and Christine continued ahead. The two of them looked out at the beginnings of the sunset and Eric reflected on the beginnings of their relationship and all of the great adventures they've had.  Caitlyn started to get nervous and thought that all this romantic talk could mean he was going to pop the question. After a few minutes, Eric said, "Okay, lets get up we can keep going." They got up to keep walking, and Eric hugged Caitlyn and then got down on one knee. Through tears Caitlyn said yes one hundred times and could not keep the biggest smile off her face.  Afterwards, they proceeded down the mountain to have dinner with both of their families.</p>
